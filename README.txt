Dijkstra Search Algorithm for Point and Rigid Mobile Robot

The following libraries have been used:-
1. numpy
2. matplotlib
3. heapq
4. math
5. time

###
To run the script for the point robot run, python dijkstra-point.py
To run the script for the rigid robot run, python dijkstra-rigid.py

Enter the start and goal coordinates as (x y), i.e. the coordinates separated by a space
For example, for start point as (5,5), enter (5 5).
"Please enter start x and y coordinate:- 5 5"

For the rigid robot, the robot radius and clearance have to be provided as well along with the start and goal coordinates.
